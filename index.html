            <h3>What is Liberation Club?</h3>
            <div>
                <p> Liberation Club is a journalling and informal speaking group for anyone who feels that they need
                    liberating
                    from some oppressive cloud hanging over them. This may be:
                </p>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                    <li>a circumstance</li>
                    <li>a personality trait</li>
                    <li>a persistent negative mood or heavy feeling that wont go away
                    <li>or a set of habits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Liberation club is for when you cannot exactly name a problem, face a "wicked problem" that cannot
                    be resolved, or feel trapped and restricted in life.</p>
                <p>
                    No situation is too trivial or serious, all are welcome. Liberation Club can help with stuck-ness,
                    malaise, inertia and depression.
                </p>

            <h3>Meetings</h3>
            <p>At weekly meetings in a cafe setting, members will have a chance to journal side by side for 30 minutes.
                Members bring their own journals and pens - you can use a hardcover journal, an exercise book, or a pad.
            </p>
            <p>Journalling can take any form: list-making, diary entries, drawing, making word clouds, collage vision
                boards - whatever helps to express and define what you want to be liberated from, what you notice you
                are oppressed by, and what you would like to achieve or change.</p>
            <p> Members are then allocated an equal amount of time each to speak aloud their thoughts to the group. Each
                member may start by stating their name and what feeling or situation brought them to the club, and then
                they may talk about their issues and speak to any plans they may have mused about or decided on to
                become liberated, or their progress towards - or changes to - any goals.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I don't know where I'm trapped, but I feel trapped. There's nothing in my life that
                relaxes me. I feel cramped and stifled. I want to break free."
            </p>
            <p>During these speaking periods, the rest of the group listens silently, without offering advice, without
                problem-solving, without judgement and without responding with their own thoughts to relate to what has
                been said. The speaking period allows each member to say aloud their thoughts, in an environment where
                they are listened to, without being challenged, argued with, helped, comforted or related to.
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the speaking turns, the meeting is officially over. Members are invited to continue silent
                journalling if they wish before leaving.</p>
            <p>Between meetings, members can journal as much as they want.</p>
            <p>Sessions are held on Monday nights and Wednesday afternoons. Contact the coordinator for times and
                locations.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Some days, I feel like I am (a little liberated). And some days, I feel like I'm back to
                square one. But I still feel I've been liberated, even just a little."

        <section class="move-anchor-up" id="rules">
            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <p>The idea and format for Liberation Club comes from the fictitous club featured in the Netflix K-drama,
                <a href="https://mydramalist.com/685441-an-untitled-jtbc-project/reviews?page=2" target="_blank">"My
                    Liberation Notes" (2022)</a>, also called "나의 해방일지"/"Naeui Haebangilji".
            </p>
            <p>As stated in the K-drama, there are three tenets, "in order to take an honest look into our lives." They
                are:
            </p>
            <ul class="regular-list">
                <li>I will not pretend to be happy. </li>
                <li>I will not pretend to be unhappy.</li>
                <li> I will be honest. (Be honest with yourself on the inside, you do not have to bare all to the others
                    in the club.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The golden rule of Liberation Club is:
            </p>
            <p class="centred">Do not give advice. Do not try to comfort.</p>
            </ul>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Further rules and guidelines governing behaviour at meetings and privacy considerations.
                </summary>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                    <li> Bring a journal or notebook to meetings, and your own writing tools. Paper and pens are not
                        supplied.
                    </li>
                    <li>Before the first meeting, think about what you are actually trying to liberate yourself from and
                        note it down in your journal. This can change from meeting to meeting or day to day as you
                        explore the topic or notice new thoughts. It can simply be a feeling of wrongness, if you are
                        stuck for how to name your "thing". You will have time to think about it more during and between
                        meetings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Chatting is discouraged during silent journalling time. Some time for introductions and talking
                        about the club will be included in each meeting, usually between journalling and between
                        speaking turns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each member is allocated an equal amount of time to speak. During a member's speaking time, only
                        the speaker may talk. Other members listen silently without offering advice, judgement, or
                        speaking about their own situation to relate to what was just said. "Do not give advice. Do not
                        try to comfort."
                    </li>
                    <li> Speakers should keep to their allocated time regardless of whether they feel finished with
                        speaking at the end of it, in order to ensure everyone receives equal speaking time.
                    </li>
                    <li>All members are invited to talk about their feelings, observations and struggle in regards to
                        their own liberation without commenting on or responding to any other member's speeches before
                        theirs.
                    </li>
                    <li>If a member cannot speak about their own liberation during a meeting due to stage fright or
                        self-consciousness, they are invited to read something from their journal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Members should retain a sense of personal privacy when speaking to the group and refrain from
                        providing details that the speaker does not feel comfortable making public.
                    </li>
                    <li> Journals will not be shared involuntarily and you will not be asked to "hand them in". They are
                        for the member to record and reflect upon their own private thoughts and to use as a resource.
                        Speaking aloud to the group is less private and so details and personal situations described in
                        the journal should be abstracted when speaking to the group.
                    </li>
                    <li>Liberation Club is not a trauma or addiction counselling service. Although these topics can be
                        dealt with in Liberation Club, the club is not suitable for those who are unable to speak about
                        their situations calmly enough to maintain a manner suitable to a cafe setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Swearing should be limited while speaking to respect other members and cafe patrons. The
                        emotional intensity of any anger or distress expressed during speaking should be moderated to a
                        level appropriate for a public setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Please avoid excessive displays of anger, grief or distress so as not to distress other club
                        members and cafe patrons. The club is a self-introspection tool for finding personal solutions
                        to oppressions, not a counselling service.
                    </li>
                    <li>Group members should respect each other's privacy and treat each other with respect at all
                        times.
                    </li>
                    <li>The speaker should avoid making other group members feel intimidated or threatened by speaking
                        about situations in which the group member causes or participates in violence.
                    </li>
                    <li>Members should seek the group's permission to discuss situations and thoughts that have
                        potential to traumatise other members - situations involving sexual assault, violence, or
                        graphic descriptions of traumatic events. Please be understanding if a group member does not
                        give consent. Be prepared to speak about such situations without describing details aloud.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is permitted to form a friendship or relationship with another member of the club, and club
                        members may chat outside of the structured context of meetings. However please do not approach
                        another member to offer advice, comfort or reflection on their situation without being invited
                        to. It is not the point of Liberation Club to meet friends and partners, or to receive advice or
                        help.
                    </li>
                    <li> Remember: the point of Liberation Club is not to solve problems or pass judgement, but to
                        provide a setting to empower people to find their own solutions to their own situations in their
                        own time, at their own pace, in their own way.
                    </li>
                    <li>Topics of addiction and abuse may be explored in this format, although Liberation Club is not a
                        solutions-offering or counselling service, and is not bound by any code of confidence (although
                        we ask members to refrain from discussing each other's situations).
                    </li>
                    <li>Participants are asked to respect others by not speaking aloud to the group about explicit
                        details of traumatic events and by keeping their voice at a conversational level during their
                        speaking turn. At all times speakers are reminded that they are speaking publicly in front of
                        laypeople, and that details of illegal activity and deeply personal and private information
                        should be spoken of in the abstract.
                    </li>
                    <li>Liberation is not a religion, or a cult, or a group for organizing political resistance. It is
                        not a counselling service or substitute for therapy. It is a tool for examining your own life
                        and finding your own way through it in an accelerated and concentrated way, using journalling
                        and sound-boarding - having your thoughts listened to silently so that you can hear them in a
                        new way.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is recommended not to join liberation club with a friend or partner, in order to be able to
                        speak about your personal situation freely without those connected to it in the room. Two weekly
                        meetings are available for partners or friends to attend separately and speak in front of
                        different groups.
                    </li>
